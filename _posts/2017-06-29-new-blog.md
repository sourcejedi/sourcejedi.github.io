title:  "New blog?"
---

I got mad at my free blog host again.  So here's a new site.

(I had a note to publish, which I had already reformatted to Markdown.  But because I'd used line breaks in the source code, i.e. hard-wrapped plain text format, Wordpress.com would display [unwanted line breaks][wordpress-doesnt-rewrap].)

This may not have been entirely rational on my part.  I do like how you write posts with Jekyll though.

The tradeoff is it's a static site.  There'll be no way to comment without Javascript.  On most such sites you can't even *read* the comments.  Right now that's all theoretical, as I haven't enabled comments.
